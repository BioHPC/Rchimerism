# Rchimerism

Interactive R Package for Automation of Chimerism Test Data Analysis

Rchimerism was designed to automatically select informative loci and calculate chimerism to monitor the cellular dynamics involving engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or relapse of recipient malignant cells in HSC transplant (HSCT) patients. 

Rchimerism starts by reading data from files generated by ABI GeneMapper and a user defined markers file. Through the shiny interface, the donor, recipient, and sample allele matrix can be visualized through interactive data tables. Overall integration
